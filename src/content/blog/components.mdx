## UI Components

UI components are basically [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) with a little bit of a customization here and there. For more information about specific UI components visit the shadcn/ui documentation. To use any of the components under `src/components/ui/` you just import and use. Feel free to customize them to fit your needs

here is an example usage for button component.

```javascript
---
import {Button} from "@/components/ui/button";
---

<Button variant="outline" size="sm">I am a button</Button>
<Button size="sm">I am also a button</Button>
<Button variant="destructive" size="sm">I am a warning you</Button>
```

import {Button} from "@/components/ui/button";

<Button variant="outline" size="sm">I am a button</Button>
<Button size="sm">I am also a button</Button>
<Button variant="destructive" size="sm">I am warning you</Button>
